**Mini Q&A Platform built with Next.js — inspired by StackOverflow.**

*QuestStack* is a hands-on project from the "**Next.js Real Project Mini Class**" hosted by **Dunia Coding** ([duniacoding.id](https://duniacoding.id/)).
In this class, I learned how to build modern web applications using Next.js and create a ready-to-develop website framework.

The website is designed as a simple question-and-answer (Q&A) platform — where users can:

- Create a question (Question)
- Give an answer (Answer)
- View a list of recent questions
- View question details and answers

The name "*QuestStack*" comes from a combination of the words *Question* and *Stack*, representing a collection of knowledge generated from various user questions - inspired by the concept of **StackOverflow**, but in a lighter and more minimalist version.

## 🛠️Tech Stack

This web application was developed using the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) — a combination of modern technologies that emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and full-stack type safety to streamline the development process.
The project was initialized with `create-t3-app`, which provides a ready-to-use structure and configuration for faster and more consistent development.

The T3 Stack main technologies used in this project include:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [NextAuth.js](https://prisma.io/)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io/)
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
